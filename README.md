# Digital_Clock_Using_IC
This project uses fundamental digital electronics components to create a functional digital clock. The design leverages ICs like the NE555 Timer, 74LS90 Counter, 74LS48 Decoder, 7-segment display, 74LS157 Multiplexer, and the 74S283 4-bit Binary Adder.

## Components
1. NE555 Timer
Acts as a clock pulse generator.
Configured in astable mode to produce a square wave for the counter.
2. 74LS90 Counter
Decade counter used for counting pulses.
Cascaded to count seconds, minutes, and hours.
3. 74LS48 Decoder
Decodes the binary output of the counter into signals suitable for driving a common-anode 7-segment display.
4. 7SEG-COM-ANODE 7 Segment Display
Displays numeric values (0-9).
Three pairs of displays are used to show seconds, minutes, and hours.
5. 74LS157 Multiplexer (2-to-1)
Combines signals to reduce the number of data lines required for driving multiple displays.
Ensures only one display is active at a time through multiplexing.
6. 74S283 4-Bit Binary Adder
Performs binary addition for adjusting the counter values when transitioning from 59 seconds to 0, or 59 minutes to 0.
## Circuit Description
1. Pulse Generation (NE555 Timer)
The NE555 timer generates a stable square wave signal.
The frequency is adjusted to 1 Hz to represent one second per pulse.
2. Counting (74LS90)
The first 74LS90 counts up to 10 (0-9) for the seconds' unit digit.
The second 74LS90 counts up to 6 (0-5) for the tens digit.
This pattern is repeated for minutes and hours, with hours capped at 24 using additional logic.
3. Decoding and Display (74LS48 and 7-SEG)
The binary output of the 74LS90 counters is sent to the 74LS48 decoders.
The decoders drive the common-anode 7-segment displays, illuminating the appropriate segments to show the digits.
4. Multiplexing (74LS157)
Only one display is activated at a time to save power and reduce wiring.
The multiplexer cycles through the displays rapidly, creating the appearance of a continuous output.
5. Binary Addition (74S283)
The adder ensures smooth transitions between counting units, like rolling over from 59 seconds to 0 and incrementing the minute counter.
